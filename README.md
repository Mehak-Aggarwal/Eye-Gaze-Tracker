# Eye-Gaze-Tracker
The project aims at developing a non-intrusive device for accurate eye-gaze tracking in real-time using a camera based tracker device for a visually impaired person. The device will help a blind person judge whether somebody is talking to them or someone else while in a group, and will also aid in identifying the people present in the room.
